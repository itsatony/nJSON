nJSON
=====

a service to log from nodeJS to a json web tree-view


## system

a simple server that

- opens a http port

- route / assigns a uuid to a new connection and redirects to /get/{{uuid}}

- route (with a http GET)  /{{uuid}} uses http://erffun.github.io/jsontree/ to show data stored in the given redis key (uuid)

- route (with a http POST or PUT)  /{{uuid}} checks for JSON data format and writes that into the redis key uuid

- all submitted data is auto-deleted after 24h



## a simple log client that

- allows njson.send(object, config) to deliver json objects to redis via the server 


## install

$ npm install njson
